# Sigma-FF2
Of course, use at your own risk. Every update to the anticheat has a risk to open up the bypass to new detections.

The codebase is one-file, incomplete, very messy, and pretty rushed. It isn't anything important so I released it because I had fun with it!

Only exploits with `hookfunction`, `hookmetamethod`, and `firetouchinterest` can use this script. 

I don't support any bad exploits which might crash and it was tested on AWP + Wave.

Have fun :)
